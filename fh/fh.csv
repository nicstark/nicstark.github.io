pocket doors raas the formal dining room with its dormer windows and gas fireplace. Otr of

It contained a closed circular stair case to the second floor and a two story addition which almost filled the back yard. The addition contained the kitchen and a laundry room on the first floor and a huge bathroom on the second floor. The yard was the cement covered hom of the family dog - Mitzie by name in the 1950's. There was an adjoining house separated by the narrowest of dark alleyways connecting the street front to the yard. The adjoining house was the home of good friends - the Connolly family. Such good friends were these families, especially the wives, Julie and Carrie, that the wood fence between their yards was eventually taken down to enhance family exchanges and give Mitzie more leg room.

Steven Stachurski,Julia Tomaszkiewicz,,,1915,1920,,,Note,"Visits to the Stachurski home were different than those to the Mostwikowski house for grandchildren. Less frequent but overnight trips were the rule. This was fine because Grandma Julie made a great pineapple upsidedown cake which required several servings to finish. Also her homemade pound cake was at its best over morning coffee. Holiday get togethers provided ample time to get to know all the cousins and the table was always covered with great hams, turkey, and polish sausage. During overnight stays the less fancy but wonderful borst and fried fish were frequently on the menu. Shopping at the far corner Ma and Pa grocery store or the Broadway Market provided two really different but exciting experiences."

Michael Mostwikowski,Eleanora Tyska,,,1930,1950,"2905 Dillon Street. Baltimore, MD",,Note," Christmas eve was a special event for the family at grandma's. A little artificial Christmas tree sat on top of the radio in the living room. All the sisters would arrive early in the day with the cousins to begin to prepare for Wigilia, a special feast but without meat in keeping with the Catholic fast of Christmas eve. The sisters would prepare fried whiting, shrimp in sauce, perogie stuffed with cottage cheese or sauerkraut, crab cakes, black bread with sweet butter and strong coffee for the adults and RC Cola for the kids. Promptly at six, when the sun had set, the feast would begin with special prayers led by grandma. After we ate and the dishes had been cleaned everyone rushed to the living room where each child received gifts from his or her aunts and uncles. Often the gifts were clothing or other ""useful"" items, which made everybody all the more anxious to get home to see what was in store under their own Christmas tree. A favorite gift was a shiny silver dollar from uncle Ed. "
Michael Mostwikowski,Eleanora Tyska,,,1930,1950,"2905 Dillon Street. Baltimore, MD",,Note,"Almost every Saturday the girls - Stella, Mary, Helen and Anna would be over to help with cleaning and household chores. This gave lots of time for the cousins to become good friends while attending the local cowboy movies, church or family gatherings. When the grandchildren arrived their grandmother would draw them aside and give them a few coppers (pennies) from her little black change purse. There was a confectionary store just around the corner next to the movie house. At that store the coppers were like gold."
Michael Mostwikowski,Eleanora Tyska,,,1930,1950,"2905 Dillon Street. Baltimore, MD",,Note,"At Easter the children were asigned the task of getting a basket of food to St. Casmir's church for the special blessing.

Michael Mostwikowski,Eleanora Tyska,,,1930,1950,"2905 Dillon Street. Baltimore, MD",,Note,"By the time grandchildren were visiting the old outhouse in the back left corner of the cement-covered backyard, it was an antique worth visiting. Behind the house was an alley separated from the yard by an old wood fence and a swinging door weighted to close with a pulley and old metal stove burner for ballast. "
Michael Mostwikowski,Eleanora Tyska,,,1930,1950,"2905 Dillon Street. Baltimore, MD",,Note,"By the time they were on Dillon Street, Michael was working in a Iicorice factory nearby; life was less hectic. "

Martin Stachurski,Helen Mostwikowski,,,1937,,"5504 Groveland
Avenue.",,Note,"Meals at the Starks \ rere usuallyfirst rate. Martin and Helen had gone through some
hard times as children because of the Great Depression, and when they were married, they
agreed never to skimp on food. Lunches were usually just sandwiches and a dessert but
dinners were special. Sunday dinner rrvas at 1:30 pm in the dining rcom and traditionally
included wine and a roast or poultry made with one of half a dozen recipes repeated for
varlation. ilJbnday found the same meal served as leftovers for the boys as they waited for
the return of the folks. Tuesdays were the night for chops; Wednesday being a day off taras
usually a casserole or some special meal which could take a little longer to prepare;
Thursday rnras steak night; Friday was fish night as nvas the tradition in Catholic households
then; and Saturday vras ethnic night with Polish or Chinese dishes being the mainstay."
Martin Stachurski,Helen Mostwikowski,Dennis Stark,Martin Stark Jr ,1937,1960,"5504 Groveland
Avenue.",,Note,"The Starks had lots of friends in the area. The Youngs, McParlands, Parkes and
other neighbors often got together for a barbecue or evening drinks. The families of Martin
and Helen often visited on holidays like the fourth of July, withthe site being rotated often.
Probably the true ""man who came to dinner"" for the family vras Harry Greenwald. Harry taas
a recent widovver when he met Martin and Dennis vfiile at a class for obedience dog
training. Soon Dennis and Harry rrrrere training the dogs on rrveekends and Harry utas invited
for more and npre dinners. Before Harry moved out of his home and took one of the
apartments on Groveland Avenue, Dennis became his lawn hy. This lrlas a way both boys
made extra money in the neighborhood, and Dennis had five regular lawn jobs at one time.
Harry became a regular member of the family and even moved to Hicks Road after the new
house uas built there."

Martin Stachurski,Helen Mostwikowski,,,1939,1945,"5504 Groveland
Avenue.",,Note,"After school Martin and Dennis returned home for homeurork and chores. The Starks dogs , German Shepards, were a neighborhood phenomenon. Often taking unauthorized walks in the woods for days and not always recognizing where the property line ended, they often kept the post school hours active. The dogs were not only pets but also when litters arrived every six months or so they became a source of family income. Shortly after Martin and Helen moved to the house they purchased a german shepard called Penny and a cat
calld Kitty. Later a lineage of german shepards began when Cassandra was rescued from the local pound. She lived with and eventualty vt/Ers succeeded by a series of offspring: Gypsy, Heidi, Heidi ll, Gretchen and Gretchen Il the latter even made it up to Hicks Road for the retirement years along with an unrelated suressor and last family dog, Penny ll. Kitty was succeeded by Silvester, a cat with cartoon qualities for the boys, the came Mahitabel and her son Timmy. Timmy ll the last of the cat lineage lived out his later years
with Dennis and Simone after Martin died. Since Chappie \rvas a full five years older than
Dennis the role of baby sitter often fell on the former. Walks through the woods in all sorts
of weather, with dogs in the lead vrere the standard Sunday fare for the males of the family."
Martin Stachurski,Helen Mostwikowski,,,1939,1945,"5504 Groveland
Avenue.",,Note,"During World War ll
there uere chickens out back and alrarays Martin had a big garden. Behind the house there
\flas a huge field bordered with cherry trees and a rock uaall which \Aiere the remains of a
real farming effort from previous years. Beyond the field \ /as a forest which went on for
miles and miles. Just down the street raas the county line and after a good hike you came to
lVlount Hope, a Catholic Church sponsored hospitalfor the mentalty ill and old age horne for
the religious community. The focal point of the extensive grounds wa a large abandoned
boat lake. During the winters the neighbofiood families urculd use this pond as their private
skating rink. Lots of the out buildings vrrere in various states of disrepair and over the years
their continued degeneration \ruas a sad thing to raratch. But for most of the boy's yrouths
Mount Hope \ilas ""the"" place to spend a long sunny or damp day. For years after the Starks
arrived the street had only a dozen houses along the very long block which ended about
500 meters past the our house located just three houses down from the cross street of
Rogers Avenue."
Martin Stachurski,Helen Mostwikowski,,,1939,1945,"5504 Groveland
Avenue.",,Note,"Each morning the day vrould start with Martin cooking up breaKast. Helen had required
that if she rnas going to rtrork she vrould be allorrrred to sleep Iate and have breaKast ready
before the start of the norkday. Usually at about 7 am the sounds of the radio moming
ne\rrrs caried into the bedrooms to roust Helen, Chappie and Dennis. On h/bndays and
Fridays the morning fare usually was made up of cereal, oat meal or toast while Tuesday,
Thursday and Saturday !\,ere the egg days. Egg days vr/ere special because only the cook
liked his eggs as raw as he usually made them, and the sounds of ""ugh"" vr/ere often the
start of a day. Sundays after Mass and a stop at the bakery, the biggest breaKast of the
week \ ias prepared. Regular meals lvere served in the kitchen with Helen and Martin on
the outside of the table and Chappie and Dennis opposite each other against the wall
where they could be better controlled but unfortunately could easily kick each other under
the table. After breaKast everybody got r€dy for what ever duties they had. The boys,
vuhile at All Saints school, started school with a required 8:15 Mass. Everybody was out of
the house by 8 am for many years all piling into thp Plymouth or Mercury. After the boys
vvere dropped orff at school Helen ralas left orff to open the shop. Mqrtin parked the car at the
Sun Papers dfice about a mile from the shop in an pffort to get qpme raqlking in each day
and to yse thecheapest parking lot in downtown."

Martin on May 16, 1942, stayed home with a house keeper Lulu. Lulu was a big friendly
\ ioman who vrould walk you all the way to the racetrack if she had a big bet on a favorite
horse. She could pass for a model for Aunt Jemima pancake mix"

Dennis Stark,,,,1947,,All Saints Prepatory School,,Note,"Dennis went through All Saints. He repeated the first grade as he was too young
wlren accepted but it enabled Helen to get back to trcrk with out a full time housekeeper.
He was not much of a student until #ter the fourth year when one of the nuns suggested
that he do extra rrvork at home over the summer after that he had several teachers who
encouraged him to catch up and he did."
Dennis Stark,Martin Stark Jr ,,,1948,,"5504 Groveland
Avenue.",,Note,"Since the
Starks had the second television in the neighborhood and since the boys urcre in charge of
the house all of Saturday the day rruas often spent watching kids shovrrs with lots of the
neighborhood kids often until it nras too late to get the chores done before the folks
returned from raork."
Martin Stark Jr,,,,1948,,"5504 Groveland
Avenue.",,Note,"Martin Junior from the time he was in the seventh grade uanted to be a priest. The folks
lyere opposed to his decision so early in life but the vocation persisted through grade
school , high school and into college where at the end of his second year, he officially tvent
off to the priesthood at The Portsmouth Priory in Mode lsland, with the family's blessing.
Till then he filled his time with numerous classmate friends, and two especially utell
received rolls in his high school dramatics club. He vuas more studious than Dennis but r,uas
faced with the same chores, and neighborhood activities. The Saturday house cleaning
was a special ritualfor the boys. Their duties included scrubbing the kitchen and bathroom
floors , dusting and vacuuming the entire house plus other special assignments."
Dennis Stark,Martin Stark Jr,,,1950,,,,Note,"Because of their difference in ages, the boys shared few friends."
Dennis Stark,,,,1950,,"5504 Groveland
Avenue.",,Note,"Dennis made friends
and enemies off and on with a number of local kids. Ken Adams lived across the street and
being a year older than Dennis he often vras both mentor and friend over the years. At
times the neighborhood heard beagle howls from them as they called to find each other. At
other times a stone thrown from opposite sides of Groveland Avenue marked some new
misunderstanding. The Rosendales lMed behind the Starks in what uas probably the
original house linked to the farmed areas mentioned earlier. Ray Rosendale was just a year
behind Dennis in school and their friendship cycled over the years too. Other kids in the
neighborhood rivere less involved in the early years but Beth Smerha, Barbara Young,
Bobby Minif Pat Agetstein, the Koffenbergers and others made the neighborhood
especially lively in the summers, The neighborhood youth regularly set up ""camps"" and
""clubs"" in the uoods, basements or fields. Several of the locals contributed pets and
roadkills to a growing annex of graves near Kitty which eventually erpanded to rnore than
forty tended plots in the field behind the house. A grade school noar marks the site."

Dennis Stark,,,,1956,,Calvert Hall High School,,Note,"He urent to Calvert Hall high school where he
decided to become a teacher. When he found out how poorly paid teaching was as a
profession in those days, he though otherwise about that vocation. The raising of the dogs,
cats and lots of turtles, fish, etc from the wild most have made the difference for when he
entered the University of Maryland it was in the preveterinary programs."
Martin Stachurski,Helen Mostwikowski,,,1960,1963,"Hereford, MD",,Note,"ln the early sixties the Starks bought a seventy acre farm north of Hereford as a
